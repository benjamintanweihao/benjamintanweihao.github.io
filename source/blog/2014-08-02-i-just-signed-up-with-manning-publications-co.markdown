## Updates on The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook

Ohai! It's been a while since the last update. I have a couple of exciting things to announce.

## I've signed up with Manning Publications Co.!

I am extremely excited to announce that the book is going to be published under [Manning Publications Co.](http://manning.com/)! You might know Manning from their _X in Action_ series. 

So, what does this mean for _you_? You will have to wait _slightly_ longer for the book. We are working hard towards an early release via the [Manning Early Access Program](http://manning.com/about/meap) (MEAP).

On the other hand, I'm pretty confident that the content and quality will be much stronger with Manning's help. The table of contents alone has seen much improvement.

## Video of the talk I gave at RedDotRubyConf 2014!

I gave my very first conference talk at [RedDotRubyConf 2014](www.reddotrubyconf.com) held in Singapore. The talk is called _"Ruby + Elixir: Polyglottin' FTW"_. I had a lot of fun putting it together and delivering the talk, and I encourage you to check out the video here:

Lastly, I would appreciate any comments or criticisms. Please help me improve at [Speaker Rate](http://speakerrate.com/talks/34731).

## Thanks!

I would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to all the people who have helped out with the book so far â€“ the reviewers, my lovely wife and awesome parents and people who emailed me asking about the book.
