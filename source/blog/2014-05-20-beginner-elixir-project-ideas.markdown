So you have been studying and playing with Elixir for quite a while, and you are pretty well-versed with the basics. There comes a point in time when you start to ask:

> What projects can I work on to learn more about Elixir?

I have asked others on the Elixir Talk Google group a similar question. The [responses](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/elixir-lang-talk/projects/elixir-lang-talk/xwEgtkOi9kQ/iUQ4bTTyMQ8J) are great, and well worth a look. I guess the main reason for this is a lot of developers (including yours truly) coming to Elixir have little experience programming concurrent, not to mention, distributed applications. Therefore, they have little experience to draw on.

So what's a beginner Elixir developer to do?

## Step 0: Do the Chat example

_Everybody_ will start with "Do the chat example". So do it, then move along to Step 1.

## Step 1: Learn to convert Erlang to Elixir

The first thing to do is learn how to convert Erlang code to Elixir. For this, the [official docs](http://elixir-lang.org/crash-course.html) is very useful. Along the way, you might even start to appreciate Elixir even more. This is important because learning how to read Erlang code opens up the _entire_ ecosystem. Believe me, it is not hard, 80% of the time. The rest of the 20%, there's always the Google group, IRC and Stack Overflow.

## Step 2: Read Erlang books

Get you hands on as many Erlang books as you can. Here's a list:

* [Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/)
* [Erlang Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518189.do)
* [Erlang and OTP in Action](http://www.manning.com/logan/)

All these books have nice example programs/exercises that can be ported over to Elixir with some effort. Even better, you can also convert the examples and exercises and put them up on a git repository to help other beginners. The last book in the list for example, walks you through building a reliable, distributed, key-value store.

## Step 3: Port existing Erlang programs

There's a wealth of interesting Erlang programs out there. I'm not saying you should port [Riak](https://github.com/basho/riak), but something like [Poolboy](https://github.com/devinus/poolboy) (self described as a _hunky pool factory_) or even a redis client such as [eredis](https://github.com/wooga/eredis).

## Step 4: Keep having a Beginner's mind

Being a beginner is a precious state to be in. Celebrate and treasure it, because it is far to easy to slip into complacency.

Thanks for reading!
