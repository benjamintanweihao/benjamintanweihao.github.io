The book is coming along nicely! It is currently being reviewed by some awesome people in the Elixir community. Therefore, I still expect quite a bit of changes to be made to the book.

If you would like to __help review the book__, do drop me an email at benjamintanweihao@gmail.com.

Here are some book stats:

* Available in PDF, MOBI and ePUB (I am considering TXT) 
* 13 Chapters 
* 200+ Pages

Writing the book has been a wonderful and humbling experience so far.

When I started the book, I wanted it to be as example-oriented as possible. There are already many excellent resources out there that do a wonderful job at explaining the core concepts. 

In this book, I set out to instead fit in as many _example projects_ as I could.

Here's a list of just some of the example projects:

* A Parallel Task Distributor 
* A full Tic-Tac-Toe Game (complete with WebSocket goodness!) 
* A Distributed and Fault-tolerant Cache

Stay tuned, because I will need your help very soon! (__Hint: What burning questions do you have for Elixir developers?__)
