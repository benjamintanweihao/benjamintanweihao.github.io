        <p>Tis&rsquo; the season for year-end reviews! Since I didn&rsquo;t do one last year, this is a good time as any to start. 2014 was the <em>best</em> year I had so far, and probably also the busiest ever. Here&rsquo;s the 10 best things that happened in 2014:</p>

<h2>#1: Got Married!</h2>

<p><img alt="Vzyxeye" src="http://i.imgur.com/vZyxEyE.jpg" /></p>

<p>My biggest achievement of 2014 has been to marry the love of my life. That&rsquo;s Hui Ling, my lovely wife. Now that the wedding preparations are behind us, I can finally get back to learning and doing awesome stuff.</p>

<h2>#2. Elixir</h2>

<p><img src="/images/coding/elixir.png" width="300px"></p>

<p><a href="http://www.elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> finally hit 1.0, and started gaining more attention. We had our very first <a href="http://elixirconf.com/">ElixirConf 2014</a>. I was pretty sad I couldn&rsquo;t make it for the first one, but I&rsquo;m crossing my fingers and toes for my talk submission to get accepted <a href="http://elixirconf.eu">ElixirConf EU 2015</a>! Slowly but surely, articles, talks and even books are springing up all over. There&rsquo;s no better time to be part of this awesome community.</p>

<h2>#3. Writing for SitePoint</h2>

<p><img src="/images/articles/sitepoint.png" width="300px"/></p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/author/btan/">6 articles</a> for SitePoint in 2014, 6 shy of my personal target. Writing for SitePoint gave me lots of practice in technical writing, and for that, I&rsquo;m very grateful. I have since gained a renewed appreciation for the writers who can deliver well-written technical pieces.</p>

<p>SitePoint is always on the <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/write-for-us/">lookout for more authors</a>.</p>

<h2>#4. Bought So Many Books</h2>

<p>With the money I earned from writing for SitePoint, I bought myself <em>lots of books</em>! As my wife can attest to, I have a pretty dismal buy-to-read ratio. Nonetheless, I&rsquo;m pretty proud of my little library:</p>

<p><img alt="My Awesome Library" src="http://i.imgur.com/xz1h1xy.jpg" /></p>

<h2>#5. Speaking at Conferences</h2>

<p>I had the privilege of speaking at 2 Ruby conferences this year. <a href="http://www.reddotrubyconf.com/">RedDot RubyConf 2014</a> was the first even conference talk I&rsquo;ve given. Even more awesome was  when my <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf 2014</a> got accepted. The best part of it all was that I got to speak about Elixir at Ruby  conferences, and I think this goes a long way to demonstrate the Ruby communities&rsquo; openness and willingness to explore new technologies.</p>

<p><img alt="9x4jpuq" src="http://i.imgur.com/9X4jPuq.png" /></p>

<p>One of the best things to come out of the conferences were making new friends, especially getting to meet all the people I&rsquo;ve only interacted from Twitter. Special shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/jimfreeze">Jim Freeze</a> who was a very welcoming figure at RubyConf. What made RubyConf 2014 extra special was the little Elixir gathering we had during lunches.</p>

<p>You can catch the presentations I gave <a href="http://confreaks.com/presenters/2702-benjamin-tan">here</a>.</p>

<h2>#6. New Job at Neo Innovation</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.neo.com/images/logo-5fdc26a5.svg" width="300px"/></p>

<p>I joined <a href="http://www.neo.com">Neo Innovation</a> in June 2014, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier working with people that are <em>wayyy</em> smarter than I am.</p>

<p>We are <a href="http://jobs.neo.com/">hiring</a>!</p>

<h2>#7. Kept Blogging</h2>

<p>I am pretty proud that I continued to blog in 2014, and while my readership is pretty modest, it has grown significantly from when I first started. It also makes me very happy when people tweet/write to me and say that the posts have helped them in some way or another.</p>

<h2>#8. The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook</h2>

<p><img alt="The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook" src="/images/writing/exotpbook.png" /></p>

<p>This was a wild ride. One year ago, I wouldn&rsquo;t even dare dream to start on a book project, but I&rsquo;m glad I did this year. I&rsquo;ve made quite a few mistakes along the way, and at the same time, extremely humbled by the amount of support the community is willing to give. Getting the book deal with <a href="http://www.manning.com">Manning Co.</a> was extremely exciting too. The entire process taught me a lot about pitching and marketing a book. </p>

<p>The book is far from done, mainly because now I have to get sign off from my editor, and also because of speaking, getting married, and honeymooning. On the bright side, I am starting to see vast improvements in the drafts.</p>

<h2>#9. The Ruby Closures Book</h2>

<p>As if one book wasn&rsquo;t enough, I am starting on another book project. Writing is still in its early stages, but there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.rubyclosur.es">landing page</a> for it.</p>

<p><img alt="The Ruby Closures Book" src="http://rubyclosur.es/images/ruby-closures-cover.png" /></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing this book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been a Ruby programmer for quite a number of years, but until recently, I have been blissfully ignorant of one of Ruby&rsquo;s most powerful features. That is, until one day, I saw a co-worker casually write a method that took in a block. Holy ****! I realized at that moment, I had a major gap in my Ruby knowledge.</p>

<p>Sure, I knew how to use blocks, and vaguely knew how to use lambdas in Rails scopes. But who was I kidding? I was never going to be a competent Ruby programmer if I didn&rsquo;t fix this.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing. I spoke to a few of my Ruby programmer friends, and guess what, the situation is the same. If you are like that then this book is for you.</p>

<p>This book will help you gain a deep understanding of Ruby&rsquo;s closures, and more importantly, how to harness its power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Through writing this book, I&rsquo;d be forcing myself to dive deep into the world of Ruby&rsquo;s blocks, <code>proc</code>s and <code>lambda</code>s, and be one step closer to a more competent Ruby developer.</p>

<h2>10. Blog and Landing Page Redesign</h2>

<p>I wanted to redesign my blog for the longest time. Unfortunately, due to my lack of CSS skills, this was on the back burner for a while. Since November, I resolved to work on my CSS, and as a form of personal motivation, I became my own client and decided to not only redesign my blog, but also do up a <a href="http://benjamintan.io">landing page</a> for myself.</p>

<p><img alt="My landing page" src="http://i.imgur.com/OYJjbFU.png" /></p>

<p>This is the first website that I did for myself that I didn&rsquo;t hate. I also got sign off from my wife, so that&rsquo;s another plus.</p>

<h2>Hello 2015!</h2>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited for 2015. I&rsquo;m looking forward to improving myself as a software developer, author and speaker. Thank you for supporting my work with your tweets, emails and comments. It meant a lot to me.</p>

<p>Have an awesome 2015!</p>
