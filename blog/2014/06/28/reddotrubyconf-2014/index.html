        <p><a href="http://www.reddotrubyconf.com/">RedDotRubyConf 2014</a> (RDRC 2014) has just ended, and what a rush! I could literally feel my head expanding from speaking with all the developers from around the world. This is the first time where I had the privillege to be a conference speaker.</p>

<p><img alt="Rdrc2014" src="/images/rdrc2014.png" /></p>

<p>I could write about how I enjoyed the talks, and all the cool people I&rsquo;ve met and learnt from, and how some of us were genuinely worried about Ruby not being able to handle multicore, but I guess that won&rsquo;t help anybody much.</p>

<p>There was one thing which bothered me for quite a bit.</p>

<h2>Where are all the local speakers?</h2>

<p>I was pretty dismayed to see a general lack of Singaporean speakers. The speaker lineup was awesome, no doubt. But I know for a fact that Singapore has no lack of talented developers. I personally think it boils down to a lack of confidence. The mere thought of standing in front of 300+ <em>really</em> smart people and presenting a technical topic can be enough to turn any potential speaker away.</p>

<p>I would know, since that kept me from speaking in RDRC 2012 and 2013. After RDRC 2013 (and watching <em>way</em> to many <a href="www.confreaks.com">Confreaks</a> videos, I was <em>determined</em> to speak at the next conference. It wasn&rsquo;t that I particularly enjoyed speaking to a large crowd.</p>

<p>It was more like me aspiring to be like the speakers – simply being able to stand in front of a crowd and share their knowledge with the community. Furthermore, I think many fail to recognise how incredibly lucky we are to have people like <a href="https://twitter.com/winstonyw">@winstonyw</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jaryl">@jaryl</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alaricesoh">@alaricesoh</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/seanxiesx">@seanxiesx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/yinquanteo">@yinquanteo</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jmpak">@jmpak</a> and Kevin Yeung to organise a Ruby conference right here in Singapore. And frankly, I think every conference organizer&rsquo;s hopes to have as many local speakers as possible.</p>

<p>So, here&rsquo;s me sharing my experience of speaking at RedDotRubyConf 2014, an (awesome!) annual Ruby conference that is held in Singapore.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Planning ahead</h2>

<p>In reality, I had around a year to prepare. It starts with having a New Year&rsquo;s Resolution. (Unlike the rest, this one I followed through.) I began by volunteering to speak at local meetup groups. I wish I could tell you that all of them went well, but I screwed up each of them in various (and unique) ways. Which was kind of the point.</p>

<p>After screwing up on various occasions, I started to realise what worked and what didn&rsquo;t. For example, <em>live coding is hard</em>. Also, <em>don&rsquo;t do it</em>.</p>

<p>Each talk took quite a bit of effort to put together. But it gave me practice on designing slides, organising and condensing material, explaining concepts in a simple way, and handling questions from the audience.</p>

<p>Another thing which I felt worked pretty well is blogging about bits of the talk that you think might be interesting, and seeing the reaction it gets. It also gives you a chance to really think about the topic as you are writing it.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Find something to speak about</h2>

<p>What interesting things have you been doing lately? If you are struggling for an answer, then you probably won&rsquo;t have nothing interesting to speak about either. Again, one good place to search for potential ideas is once again <a href="www.confreaks.com">Confreaks</a>. So stop playing Candy Crush, 2048, or any of those time-sucking games. Find. Something. Interesting.</p>

<p>Read the abstracts and pick out the topics that interest you. See how they are written – obviously they are good, otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t have been accepted in the first place.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Submitting the CFP</h2>

<p>Look out for CFPs. <a href="https://twitter.com/reddotrubyconf">Follow</a> the conference Twitter handle for updates. Simple stuff.</p>

<p>Now that you have done some interesting stuff, and have probably seen enough examples, you can start writing the Call for Proposal, or CFP for short. First, <em>start early</em>. Writing the CFP for me was harder than I thought.</p>

<p>Asking for feedback from people who gave talks in similar conferences is also invaluable. For that, I had <a href="https://twitter.com/sausheong">Sau Sheong</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/luweidewei">Lu Wei</a> to thank.</p>

<p>Most conferences I know of also allow more than one entry to be submitted. So don&rsquo;t stop at 1! Here&rsquo;s mine:</p>

<p><img alt="Proposal" src="/images/proposal.png" /></p>

<h2>Step 4: Preparing the material</h2>

<p>I started around 2 months before hand. Getting to start was tough. Do I design the slides first? Do I work on the example code first?</p>

<p>I found what worked for me was to get a rough outline of the presentation, then develop the rest of the content around it. Also, the process is not necessarily linear. I started in the middle portion of the slides, worked towards the end, then started at the beginning &hellip; you get the drift.</p>

<p>Developing the code examples was slightly trickier. Part of the stuff I wanted to present, I <em>sort of</em> knew it would work in theory, but I haven&rsquo;t tried it out at that point of time. That contributed to some of the unneeded anxiety. When I finally got the code working, I felt a huge weight lifted off. So, <em>have your code ready ASAP</em>. (Mad props to <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_mccord">Chris McCord</a> for sharing his Elixir ideas which ended as part of the presentation.)</p>

<p>I was super ready to give live coding another try, despite my failed attempts before. The more I read about other speakers&rsquo; experiences, the more I decided that it was out of my league. ScreenFlow to the rescue! I recorded my demos and embedded them in the slides. No context switching, no typos, no screwups.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my favorite recorded demo:</p>

<h2>Step 5: Practicing</h2>

<p>At this point of time, I had 2 weeks left, and getting slightly panicky again. Now, the focus was on the script.</p>

<p>Now, simply writing down the script, and <em>thinking</em> it sounds good isn&rsquo;t going to cut it. There are a couple of reasons for this. Unless you mouth the words out, you are <em>not</em> going to realize the words that you mis-pronounce, or sentences which just sound awkward when you say it out loud. I had to modify a substantial part of my script after I went through this process.</p>

<p>Once I had that ironed out, it was time to test it out on a live human audience. The victim in this case was my wife. She had to go through at least 5 rehearsals, which I think isn&rsquo;t too bad (she might claim otherwise). The comments that resulted were hard to swallow, but I knew they were right. So I kept going until she gave me the green light. That was just the day before the conference.</p>

<h2>Before the Talk</h2>

<p>I was totally looking forward to speaking. Also, the talks before mine just flew by.
Protip: Go to the washroom before your talk. Because &hellip;</p>

<p><img alt="Sith" src="/images/sith.jpg" /></p>

<h2>Payoff</h2>

<p>My colleagues at <a href="http://www.neo.com/offices/singapore">Neo</a> <em>didn&rsquo;t sleep</em> throughout my presentation, I managed to get a couple of questions from the audience, and no one threw me out of a Ruby conference for talking about Elixir. By all measure, it was a success.</p>

<p>The other nice side effect is people come to you, instead of having you go to them. I have to work on randomly approaching somebody and &ldquo;OHAI I&rsquo;M BEN!&rdquo;. I would rather much prefer people approaching me. Unless they are going to throw me out of a Ruby conference.</p>

<p>Having people tell you that your presentation didn&rsquo;t suck is also quite comforting.</p>

<h2>Ending Notes</h2>

<p>Preparing for a conference talk took <em>way</em> more effort than I thought – just like any software endeavour. But, it was well worth the effort. I particularly enjoyed meeting the people after my talk who shared similar experiences, and not to mention a nice sense of accomplishment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this to encourage anyone who might be sitting on the fence with the CFP to just say &ldquo;screw this, let&rsquo;s give it a shot&rdquo;. Who knows, it might be the best thing you did for yourself.</p>

<p>On to RDRC 2015!</p>
