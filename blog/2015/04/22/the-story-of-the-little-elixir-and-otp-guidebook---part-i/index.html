        <p>Unlike most of my posts, this one is going to be a retrospective of the writing process of <a href="http://www.manning.com/tanweihao?a_aid=exotpbook&amp;a_bid=99f537ec">The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook</a>. I especially enjoy reading about behind-the-scenes stories like the one I am about to tell you. Hopefully, you are no different. </p>

<h2>It started with stickers.</h2>

<p>I am a sucker for stickers. One fine day, a certain <a href="https://twitter.com/pragdave">Dave Thomas</a> was asking on Twitter who wanted Elixir stickers. I am someone who would ever miss up on something <em>free</em>, obviously wanted a <em>gajillion</em> stickers. Didn&rsquo;t matter where I was going to stick them.</p>

<p><img alt="Stickers OMG!" src="http://i.imgur.com/0kIMYFX.png" /></p>

<p>Ok fine, so I just asked for <em>three</em>. <em>Two</em> whole days passed (two days is too long to wait for stickers) and Dave finally replied:</p>

<p><img alt="Dave Thomas is awesome" src="http://i.imgur.com/HV8Polg.png" /></p>

<p>Holy crap! Dave Thomas – Mr. Pragmatic Programmer – read my blog post! I hope I wasn&rsquo;t interpreting it the wrong way, but he seemed to suggest that I was somewhat capable of writing a book. Ha!</p>

<h2>Blogging, blogging.</h2>

<p>I kept blogging. Initially, I wrote about design patterns. After an abysmal three posts, I decided to abandon the effort and focused on Elixir. I couldn&rsquo;t get enough of it. I could see the excitement and community gradually swell. Sure, it was hard work, but it as <em>addictive</em> too, more so when people are enjoying what you write.</p>

<h2>Cover design, Title, Domain Name</h2>

<p>Dave might have never thought twice about the email he sent, but somehow that nagging message kept prodding at the back of my head.</p>

<p>One fine day, I gave in. Since Elixir was fairly unknown then, I decided to create a sales page. By then I was hell bent on writing a book, any book, on Elixir. But I also wanted to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t going to waste my precious youth (ha-ha). </p>

<p>You know how some developers have trouble starting a project if they didn&rsquo;t had a good name? I had the writer&rsquo;s equivalent. First, I had to decide on a cover. I headed over to the <a href="http://thenounproject.com/">Noun Project</a> and picked me a nice logo. For the background, I went for <a href="http://subtlepatterns.com/">Subtle Patterns</a>. I designed everything in &hellip; wait for it &hellip; PowerPoint.</p>

<p>Next, I had to figure out a good title. I knew it had to contain &ldquo;Elixir&rdquo; and &ldquo;OTP&rdquo;. I started to research titles. I came across <a href="www.littleriakbook.com">A Little Riak Book</a> and <a href="http://riakhandbook.com/">Riak Handbook</a>. A little bit here, a little bit there, and I settled on a title. Having &ldquo;Little&rdquo; was great too, because it explicitly told people <em>not</em> to expect that much content.</p>

<p>Domain name came next. Here were some of the ones I came up with: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>thelittleelixirandotpguidebook.com</code> (Too long, duh)</li>
<li><code>elixirotpguidebook.com</code> (I kept noticing &ldquo;rot&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided that <code>www.exotpbook.com</code> made for a good compromise. With all that out of the way, I had enough material to make me a landing page. <a href="https://www.launchrock.com/">LaunchRock</a> was perfect for this. </p>

<h2>Did people even bother? Well, yes!</h2>

<p>As soon as I launched the page and announced it to the world (maybe 10 people were listening), I nervously kept refreshing the page every 5 minutes or so, just to see if there were any new sign ups. Thankfully, by the end of the week, I had around 100+ signups. Looks like it&rsquo;s a go! </p>

<h2>Publisher and Publishing</h2>

<p>I settled for <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a>, a service created by Michael Hartl, of Rails Tutorial fame. I especially enjoyed the toolchain. I could write the manuscript Markdown, and it spat out EPUB, MOBI and PDF. I really didn&rsquo;t think about payments then. I was obsessing more about the tools used to write the book. Not only did Softcover provide the toolchain, it had a marketing page and other bells and whistles which made it a very pleasant platform to write on.</p>

<p><img alt="Softcover" src="http://i.imgur.com/tWr1WpX.png" /></p>

<p>I briefly considered LeanPub, but dismissed it because I thought its fonts were too damn ugly. I have a LeanPub book <a href="https://leanpub.com/therubyclosuresbook">here</a>.</p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>I thought up the Table of Contents, was pleased with it, and proceeded to begin writing on the 23rd of February, 2014. Along the way, I set up MailChimp for sign ups and newsletters. </p>

<p>And so it began:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>% git log | tail                                                
commit b2ef2ac7d730d11066e9d81615e5f070ebbf43e0
Author: Benjamin Tan Wei Hao &lt;benjamintanweihao@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Sun Feb 23 10:54:17 2014 +0800

    Initial commit.
</code></pre></div>
<h2>I needed help &hellip;</h2>

<p>Along the way, I knew I needed reviewers. I reached out to the Elixir community, and also to other developers via the <a href="http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=e6c489d8ae654374bfa191d29&amp;id=4ee1177637">mailing list</a>. I wasn&rsquo;t placing much hope in it, but it was worth a try.</p>

<h2>&hellip; and help came pouring!</h2>

<p>The response was <em>incredible</em>. Developers from all over reached out. Some even sent me their <em>résumés</em>. I was absolutely floored and humbled. In the end, I had to <a href="https://us3.admin.mailchimp.com/campaigns/show?id=725449">turn down many requests</a>. </p>

<p>As the months went by, I received numerous other emails from developers wanting to volunteer their time. Once again, I thank each and every one of you who wrote to me.</p>

<p>I went on to set up a Trello board for the reviewers:</p>

<p><img alt="Trello" src="http://i.imgur.com/8PR5XIO.png" /></p>

<p>The reviewers and I started on the 1st of May 2014. The plan was to release June/July 2014, just in time for the inaugural ElixirConf. That was the plan until Manning contacted me.</p>

<h2>Ohai, Manning!</h2>

<p>On the 6th of June, 2014, I received an email from Michael Stephens, the Associate Publisher from Manning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mike Stephens with Manning Publications here. I’ve seen your page for The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook and it looks like it’s going to be  a wonderful addition to the books announced on Elixir.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was totally freaking out and dancing around by then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m wondering whether you’d be interested in the possibility of publishing with Manning rather than self publishing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh hell yes. </p>

<p>So far, the people at Manning have been super friendly. My only gripe is the constant back and forth, though I think most of it is unavoidable. This is in part that writing a book is tough, and also made tougher when we operate on different timezones. One fine day I will write about the entire Manning experience.</p>

<h2>Ohai, The Little Elixir/OTP Guidebook!</h2>

<p>The totally amount of effort needed to put together a book, even though it contains 3 chapters, is daunting to say the least. While I did all the writing, it was extremely heartening to have the community donate their time and energy into making the book better, from its earliest stages to its current iteration.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m super stoked that I can finally get the book into the hands of readers. There&rsquo;s just the small thing of writing the <em>rest</em> of the chapters. </p>

<p>Besides the fantastically smart people behind Elixir and all the wonderful Elixir libraries, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s really an Elixir <em>expert</em>. At least I&rsquo;m far from being one. I just like to about write things that other smart people make.</p>

<h2>How&rsquo;s the book doing?</h2>

<p>So far it&rsquo;s selling pretty well! I expect it to surpass 300 by the end of the week. Thanks for all the support – My wife and I thank you!</p>
